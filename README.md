A Cyber attack detection model based on machine learning is a system.
That uses algorithms to analyze network and system data, identifying patterns and anomalies to detect potential cyber threats or malicious activities.
A reliable Cyber Attack Detection Model (CADM) is a system that works as safeguard for the users of modern technological devices and assistant for the operators of networks. 
The research paper aims to develop a CADM for analyzing the network data patterns to classify cyber-attacks. 
CADM finds out attack wise detection accuracy using ensemble classification method. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms have been used for classification.
Researchers have used different techniques like Blameless Bayes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with datasets like KDD99 for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
However, KDD99 is old and lacks information on modern attack types. So, we choose to use the more recent CICIDS2017 dataset for our study. 
It contains up-to-date information and includes new attack types, unlike KDD99.
These systems may exhibit limitations in timely threat detection, struggle with encrypted data, generate false alarms.
And require significant human intervention, highlighting challenges in addressing the dynamic nature, inability to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a biometric security measure, and many more.
So we proposed a system,The proposed system has four main steps. 
First, we normalize the dataset to make sure all features are on the same scale. Then, we split the dataset into testing and training sets. 
After that, we use four different algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to create our IDS models. 
Finally, we evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to see how well they detect intrusions.
Software requirements - Python IDE 3.7 version (or) Anaconda 3.7 (or)Jupiter (or) Google Colab
Hardware requirements - OS: Windows, Linux, Processor: minimum intel i3, Ram: minimum 4 GB, Hard disk  : minimum 250 GB
At the present time, assessments of help vector machine, ANN, CNN, Random Forest and significant learning estimations reliant upon current CICIDS2017 dataset were presented moderately. 
Results show that the significant learning estimation performed generally best results over SVM, ANN, RF and CNN.. 
Every one of these estimation assists us with recognizing the digital assault in network. 
It occurs in the manner that when we think about long back a long time there might be such countless assaults occurred.
So when these assaults are perceived then the highlights at which esteems these assaults are going on will be put away in some datasets!
